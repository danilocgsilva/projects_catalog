# Project

The main business from the system.

# Environment

An environment where the project is installed. For example, can be an development environment.

# RepositoryAddress

An address for project. Obs: one repository address must relates to just one Projetc. But a Project, for some reason, can be stored in several repositories - although it is not an expected situation.
