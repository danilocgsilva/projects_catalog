# Frontend compilation

This project uses:

* symfony encore
* Tailwindcss

The steps taken by the first time to compile the frontend is here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/symfony.

In addition to the official Tailwind setup for Symfony, we also have the https://symfony.com/bundles/TailwindBundle/current/index.html reference that can be used as a complement.

## Build

```
composer install
npm install
```

For development, run:
```
npm run watch
```
